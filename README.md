# Normalized-Difference-Vegetative-Index-Project
This beginner project focuses on calculating and analyzing the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to monitor and assess vegetation health. NDVI is a widely-used remote sensing index that helps in understanding vegetation dynamics by analyzing satellite imagery data. The project includes features to save processed data and visualizations.
